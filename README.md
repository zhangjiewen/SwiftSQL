**SwiftSQL** is a micro Swift [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) wrapper, solid and meticulously documented. It maps directly to the SQLite concepts and doesn't introduce anything beyond them.

**SwiftSQLExt** introduces some basic conveniences on top of it.

SwiftSQL was created for [Pulse](https://github.com/kean/Pulse) where it is embedded internally. The entire library is just 300 lines of code, but it gets you 80% there.

# Usage

### `SQLConnection`

To start reading or writing to a database, you need to open a connection.

```swift
let db = try SQLConnection(url: storeURL)
```

By default, the database is opened in readwrite mode and is created if it doesn't exist.

### `SQLStatement`

An instance of `SQLStatement` represents a single SQL statement that has been compiled into binary form and is ready to be evaluated.

Think of each SQL statement as a separate computer program. The original SQL text is source code. A prepared statement object is the compiled object code. All SQL must be converted into a prepared statement before it can be run.

#### Lifecycle

The life-cycle of a prepared statement object usually goes like this:

1. Create the prepared statement object using a connection:

```swift
let statement = try db.prepare("""
INSERT INTO Users (Name, Surname)
VALUES (?, ?)
""")
```

> Once you compiled the statement, use `statement.info` to get additional information about it.

2. Bind values to parameters using one of the `bind()` methods. The provided values must be one of the data types supported by SQLite (see `SQLDataType` for more info)

```swift
try statement.bind("John", "Appleseed")
```

3. Execute the statement.

```swift
// Use `execute()` to execute a statement
try statement.execute()

// If the statement returns multiple SQL rows, you can step in a loop
// and use `column()` family of methods to retrieve values for the current row. 
while try statement.step() {
    let name: String = statement.column(at: 0)
}
```

4. (Optional) To reuse the compiled statementt, reset it and go back to step 2,
do this zero or more times.

```swift
try statement.reset()
```

The compiled statement is going to be automatically destroyed when the
`SQLStatement` object gets deallocated.

#### Chaining

All of the methods outlined in the previous section are chainable:

```swift
try db.prepare("INSERT INTO Users (Name) VALUES (?)")
    .bind("Alex")
    .execute()
```

### `SQLDataType`

`SQLDataType` makes it possible to use native `Swift` types to work with SQLite. Supported types:

- `Int`
- `Int32`
- `Int64`
- `String`
- `Data`

> To add support for custom data types, like `Bool` or `Date`, see [Advanced Usage Guide](https://github.com/kean/SwiftSQL/blob/0.1.0/Docs/advanced-usage-guide.md)

# Extensions

**SwiftSQLExt** introduces some basic conveniences on top the core framework.

### Mapping Rows

Add conformance to `SQLRowDecodable` to use convenience APIs for converting rows into your model entities.

```swift
// Fetch all of the rows
let users = try db
    .prepare("SELECT Name, Level FROM Users ORDER BY Level ASC")
    .rows(User.self)
    
// Or only the next row
statement.row(User.self)

// Or the next N rows
statement.rows(User.self, count: 50)
```
